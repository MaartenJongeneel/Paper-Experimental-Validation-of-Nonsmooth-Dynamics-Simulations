Introduction
============

<!-- The content of this repository is associated to the paper "Learning Suction Cup Dynamics from Motion Capture: Accurate Prediction of an Object's Vertical Motion during Release". The objective for this project was to create a 1D release model of a suction cup, that would describe the position, velocity, and acceleration of the object after it is released from the suction cup. This project is part of the [I.AM. project](www.i-am-project.eu) on Impact Aware Manipulation. More specifically, this paper is the first step to understanding the release dynamics of an object in the full 6D case. This is important to know within the concept of autonomous tossing of parcels in logistic applications.  -->
